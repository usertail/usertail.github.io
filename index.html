            <p style="font-family:helvetica" ;> I enjoy playing video games and playing table tennis.
                I also like to sleep in on the weekends and watch youtube.
                I live with my mom and dad and also my sister.
                <strong> My sister is moving out whenever Covid 19 ends because she is going to university. </strong>
                My grandparents are in a seperate apartment and are living off their retirement money.
                I like talking to my friends on my free time. </p>
